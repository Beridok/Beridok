ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m Ryszard C. aka @Beridok - but since we're online, use nickname, unless you mean official business.

## Programming

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... everything about programming and coding. Though not every language possible =)

Mostly from [Pasja informatyki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn6vAfspIcagLax1fck_jw) Youtube Channel by MirosÅ‚aw Zelent and Damian Stelmach.

Currently (as of January 2022), I am trying to get commercial experience within programming. 
I know just plain basics of web development apparently - __JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and HTML__. I still have plenty of to discover (Angular, Vue, React, Node.js) to create projects effectively from scratch.

Currently what I did as UserScripts seems more like website hacking, than actually building pages. I only build from scratch couple times: [TMCalculator](https://github.com/Beridok/TMCalculator) and [Gamepad Visualizer for TrackMania games](https://github.com/Beridok/JS-TMGamepadVisualInputs) - because back then I had Windows 7 and existing solutions worked only on Windows 10.

## Interests

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [video games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Beridok/), [trance music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppc4G_9xiUE&list=PLwepFBtUcH2A9-110ESezJJBesPPJ4qeP), [puzzle solving](https://www.steamgifts.com/discussions/puzzles-events), somewhat video production and also a little bit of streaming.

__And creating UserScripts for Tampermonkey is my hobby.__

Always looking for way to decrease amount of my clicks I need to do on certain websites. Or copy-pasting. Well, there are many ways you can speed up processes - especially, if you have this habit of going full-on on topic. When I download additional maps for a game, I usually try to get them all. A bit crazy, I know.

ðŸ“« Contact - quickest way would be through Discord: Beridok#7380, but also e-mail: beridok [you-should-know-what] gmail.com
